# React coding test

## Overview

This React application is a landing page and was set-up using create-react-app.

## Challenges:

No ui/ux design for mobile view so it was quite difficult to design for that.


## Technologies And Installation
Utilizes React's component-based architecture for building reusable UI elements, demonstrates state management using useState and useEffect hooks along with React's built-in state and props mechanism, and uses vanilla and Tailwind CSS for styling components which can be easily customized according to your project requirements.

To run this React application locally, clone the repository (git clone https://github.com/Lekan659/Landingpagetest.git), navigate to the project directory (cd landingpagetest), install dependencies (npm install), start the development server (npm start), and open your web browser to http://localhost:3000 to view the application
